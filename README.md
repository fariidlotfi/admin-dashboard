My first admin dashboard that coded with REACT, Tailwind CSS and Material UI.

[View Online Demo](https://admin-dashboard-pi-ten.vercel.app/)

I use Tailwind CSS for its GRID system, which is too powerful for creating Responsive Webpages. Besides, I use Material UI for some COMPONENTS like Data Grid, Charts and so on.

This app is too simple and has no backend, which means it doesn't save any data in background like database or local storage.

Here are some screenshot of the app:
